# desafio-front

This is a front-end test. The application has a special selection of products and it uses two forms, one to get the user's data and another one to get a friend name and e-mail to suggest some products via e-mail. 
I developed this application based on a wireframe, developing desktop and mobile version. I also developed the e-mail page version to send to a friend using "table" tags. 
It's a pretty symple version using only Javascript, CSS and HTML. I didn't add any framework or library as the challenge was to build the application without any of them if possible. The products come from an API.

I intend to develop a better version of it using frameworks and plugins as soon as possible.
